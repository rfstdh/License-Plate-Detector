# License-Plate-Detector

It is my first project regarding Computer Vision and Machine Learning topic, so please keep that in mind while reviewing my code. 

Current form of repository doesn't contain dataset as it's just too big to be reasonably copied.
In order for this program to work you just need to visit http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/CVSSP/demos/chars74k/ and download EnglishImg.tgz,
then unpack it and change root folder name to Data. That's all.
